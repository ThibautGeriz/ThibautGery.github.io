I wanted to give the [Elm] language a try because of multiple reason:

* The [Javascript fatigue](http://thefullstack.xyz/javascript-fatigue/) I just can keep up with all framework and library in JS to setup a website, I has became so complex.
* I love functional programming and Javascript is only partly functional, for example the language is not fully immutable (even if it's better with `const` keyword in EcmaScript6)


**TL:DR:** My expectations are partly achieved: they are not must library but you still need too much tools around your project. The language being close to [Haskell] is definitely functional, there is no state (at least they are "hidden") and the language rely on Message to exchange informations. It feels sometimes a bit of a burden but only because I am a beginner.

First of all I chose the following tutorial [www.elm-tutorial.org](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/) and the produced code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ThibautGery/elm-tuto).



*Note:* I discovered after another [tutorial](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop) which seems to cover more things.
