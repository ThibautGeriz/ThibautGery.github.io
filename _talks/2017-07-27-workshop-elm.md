Creating your next front application using pure functions is not a dream anymore. Elm enables you to code without any side effect with immutability, monads… This will allow you to test your code easily. Let’s discover this ecosystem, its strengths, and limits.


After a small language introduction, we will dive into the workshop: in a simple web application, we will code some functionality in code with the help of failing tests to guide us.
