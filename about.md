title: About

My name is Thibaut GÃ©ry, I am a French software engineer working in Paris for
[Octo](http://www.octo.com/en). I like to build new things (usualy coding),
learning new skills, dancing (mostly Rock'n'roll), running, climbing, skiing.


You will likely find articles about the thing I love creating during my work as
a software programmer :

 * How to build a distributed and resilient infrastructure with Ansible and
 Docker
 * How to write beautiful code with NodeJs or Scala.
